🔐 The Caesar Cipher: A Classic Encryption Technique 🔐

Ever wondered how ancient encryption worked? The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest cryptographic techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who used it to send secret messages! 🏛

How It Works:

The idea is simple:
🔹 Shift each letter in the message forward (or backward) by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.
🔹 If the shift moves past 'Z', it wraps around to 'A' (and similarly for lowercase letters).

For example, with a shift of 3:
🔸 HELLO → KHOOR

Decryption?

Just shift the letters back by the same number!

Is It Secure?

❌ Not really! Since there are only 25 possible shifts, it can be cracked using brute force in seconds.
✅ But it’s a great introduction to the world of cryptography!

In today’s world, we rely on much more advanced encryption techniques, but the Caesar Cipher remains a fascinating look at how secret communication began.
